# ~/css

CSS basically "tells" the HTML files how to display the data as given. 
It can be overlayed into HTMLusing the ```<style>``` tag, but it is ALWAYS better to have it in a different file and folder, so that the HTML code is not super huge and visual details are separated from data that is to be displayed. 
Also takes lesser time to troubleshoot and edit. 

Holds all the CSS files for the project. Sample file nicked from <a href="https://github.com/suobset/iCons">suobset/iCons</a> (the project I have done for iCons).

Sample file will be changed later on acc to our needs, obviously.

This CSS file was made by me in an all-nighter for another project, go look at that repository if curious :)
