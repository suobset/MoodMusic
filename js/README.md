# ~/js

JavaScript is what is used for most of the backend: the stuff that makes all the interactive elements of a website work. So Spotify and YouTube APIs, along with our own code to make it work. 

To execute a JavaScript file on a website, we use the ```<script>``` tag in the HTML files. 

Sample nicked from <a href="https://github.com/suobset/iCons">suobset/iCons</a> (the project I have done for iCons).

Sample shows an interactive chart in our page. Sample written by me in that all nighter.
